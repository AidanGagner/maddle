# Maddle

Maddle is a blatant rip-off of Mad-Libs and my first ever published program. I built Maddle for the sole purpose of helping me learn Python (I'm an absolute beginner) and would love feedback and suggestions from anyone with more experience!

Maddle reads .txt story templates and prompts players to fill in their own words over placeholders written in brackets (like [noun], [verb], etc.). Write and share your own story templates!


## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external libraries
